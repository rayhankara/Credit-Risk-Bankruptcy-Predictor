## Bankruptcy Prediction Model

This project is an ensemble machine learning model designed to predict company bankruptcy with high accuracy and recall, minimizing the risk of false negatives. The model combines a neural network, random forest, and logistic regression, achieving 97% accuracy and 81% recall.

### Project Highlights

- **Model Architecture**: Ensemble model integrating neural network, random forest, and logistic regression to maximize predictive accuracy and robustness.
- **Data Preparation**: Comprehensive data preprocessing and feature engineering, including selection of financial ratios like Return on Assets (ROA), Debt Ratio, and Altman Z-Score to enhance prediction reliability.
- **Optimization**: Fine-tuned with threshold adjustments and balanced class weights to improve recall, particularly focused on minimizing false negatives to capture potential bankruptcies effectively.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, and Pandas.

### Key Results

- **Performance**: The model achieved 97% accuracy and 81% recall, providing a reliable tool for bankruptcy risk assessment with minimal false negatives.
- **Real-World Applicability**: By focusing on false negatives, this model is particularly useful in financial risk management contexts where missing a bankruptcy prediction has significant consequences.
