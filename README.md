Creddy: Credit Risk Chrome Extension

Project Overview:
Developed Creddy, an ensemble machine learning model integrated into a Chrome extension, to predict company bankruptcy with 90% accuracy and 93% recall. The extension prioritizes minimizing false negatives to enhance reliability in financial risk management.

Key Features:
Automated Financial Data Extraction: Scrapes financial parameters from a company's balance sheet, income statement, and statement of cash flows.
Risk Prediction Outputs: Provides both a binary risk prediction and a risk probability.
Altman Z-Score Comparison: Compares the risk prediction output with the Altman Z-Score to determine a comprehensive risk level for the company.
Target Audience: Designed for external investors, company employees, and interested applicants seeking financial insights.

Data Preparation:
Conducted extensive preprocessing and feature engineering.
Selected key financial ratios such as ROA, Debt Ratio, and Altman Z-Score to enhance prediction reliability.

Optimization:
Fine-tuned model thresholds and balanced class weights to boost recall, ensuring effective identification of potential bankruptcies.

Technologies Used:
Programming Languages & Libraries: Python, NumPy, Pandas, PyTorch, scikit-learn, Seaborn.
Deployment Tools: Chrome extension framework for seamless integration and user accessibilit
